			<h1><strong>Statelessness in Southeast Asia: Millions in Limbo</strong></h1>
			<h3> Statelessness has long been a widely overlooked problem, especially in developing countries. It is time to pay attention to the human rights and dignity of those who are living a life in uncertainty.</h3>

			<p>Looking out from the wooden boat under the scorching July sun of the 2019 summer, I saw the sparkle on the light brown water of Tonlé Sap lake, Siem Reap, Cambodia. From afar, we can see boats upon boats, floating, wobbly with the soft breeze. The uneven red and brown roofs and dark blue plastic cover the floating homes of many individuals —– the stateless people of Vietnamese ethnicities in Cambodia.</p>
<p>Among the crowded houses loosely attached by ropes, I saw dirty white foam boxes steered by children of just seven or eight years old as they approached us, carrying snakes to entertain or begging for money. Just a few minutes of drifting further into the community, the boat was surrounded by children and women with faces squinted under the burning sun. Upon talking with residents of the lake, I have come to learn an ugly truth: most children here stop school early, just after primary education that was provided by a school set up by a couple of boats connected together with flimsy wooden boards. The school itself provided free meals for students, but can only offer some sort of education and then released them back to their family—whom the children would need to help out early on in life. The main sources of income here are fishing and begging; stable jobs are a luxury for these individuals. A family can barely afford to get by, saving all they own for the rainy days, or, especially, for sickness. Lacking health insurance, a period of illness is enough to empty the family's earnings. Precarity and uncertainty are the common themes in the lives of these people. But, why?</p>

			Many of us in the twenty-first century have come to take our citizenship for granted. In many countries, the citizens grow up in an environment where roads were built, social security and welfare systems are firmly in place, public schools are funded, healthcare systems ensure very basic needs of individuals, and law and order are the norms of society. However, these institutions and concepts are quite foreign to the stateless population in Cambodia. The government here attempted to issue citizenship for this group by requiring them to buy and maintain a permanent residence card for seven years by paying <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cambodia-landrights-refugees/no-room-on-water-no-home-on-land-for-cambodias-ethnic-vietnamese-idUSKCN1TS03L">250,000 riel</a> or around $62 biannually. This fee is, nevertheless, for many people who live in this area, a large sum that cannot be easily afforded, especially for a large family that depends on seasonal works of their parents or the day-to-day amount of money earned from tourists. Life is hard for those who could not afford this $62 fee as they were deprived of the supplies for their own basic needs. Individuals without citizenship or the residence card cannot find a stable job, or even send their kids to receive a proper education preparing them for the workforce. Without an occupation, in turn, they could not afford the fee, meaning that their path to citizenship became even more obscure. And the vicious cycle begins again, trapping generations upon generations of people in poverty and uncertainty, which then ingrain in them the fear of deportations. This group navigates life with the constant threats of deportation, without even knowing where will they be deported to, for the Vietnamese government would not take on the burden of housing millions in poverty without useful skills. And, this is not the story of a single country, but a story of many across the world.</p>

	Under the <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/ibelong/wp-content/uploads/1954-Convention-relating-to-the-Status-of-Stateless-Persons_ENG.pdf">1954 Convention</a> on the status of stateless persons, a stateless individual is legally defined as someone “who is not considered as a national by any State under the operation of its law.”  In 2019, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees released the Global Trends report which concerns itself with problems pertaining to immigration and human rights. That year, the total number of stateless people is indicated to be 4,161,979 individuals. However, not only is the data only available for a total of 76 countries, it is most likely that these figures are inaccurate. Data undercounting has been one of the central obstacles in addressing the problem of statelessness. According to Elizabeth Cohen, Professor in the Political Science Department at Syracuse University, this understudy of statelessness is the testament in itself for the powerlessness of these individuals since they do not have for themselves a powerful voice or advocates. To add on to the problem, Cohen also remarked that larger and powerful countries in North America or Europe are more likely to be overstudied, neglecting smaller nations.</p>

		<p>The world saw a high concentration of stateless population in Northern and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and, especially Southeast Asia. With a total population of around 662 million people, Southeast Asia takes up just around 9% of the world population. In 2019, however, the region’s total population of statelessness of more than a million people accounts for over 25% of the world’s stateless population. This data begs further investigation into this particular region.</p>

<p>The two UN conventions together set out a framework to ensure the basic human rights of stateless individuals and a detailed plan on how to prevent and eventually eliminate statelessness. However, these two extensive frameworks remain quite unpopular among Southeast Asian nations with only the Philippines signing on to the 1954 Convention, after almost 70 years. To date, no country in this region agreed to the provisions in the <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/protection/statelessness/3bbb286d8/convention-reduction-statelessness.html">1960 Convention</a>. These nations' detachment from the global efforts in this issue might be due partly to these countries’ economic and political standing. Upon conversation with Chau Van Chi, the President of the Khmer-Vietnamese Association, a part of Cambodian Interior Ministry, it becomes quite apparent that the government of Cambodia is reluctant to address the issues and protect basic human rights for individuals. However, it is very unlikely that this is a moral question, but rather, a possibility one. Countries like Cambodia see a heavily burdened welfare system and infrastructure problems for their own citizens. On the road to meet with the stateless population, we passed vast areas of underdeveloped lands with individuals traveling on broken vehicles, racing the weather to earn a living. In fact, the tourist attractions in Cambodia stand out not just for its beauty, but also for the luxurious exterior and lavishness of these complexes, standing in such stark contrast to other parts of the country. Addressing the issue of statelessness requires massive resources that these nations in the developing area of the world find it difficult to afford, especially when their own countries are still fighting against high levels of poverty and unemployment. Who then should we turn to for help for this “powerless” group neglected by the law?</p>

From 2016 to 2017, the stateless population in Southeast Asia decreased quite significantly, especially from 2016 to 2017 from the highest point of over 1.4 million individuals to the lowest at just above 1 million. This trend is accounted for largely by the decrease in stateless population in Myanmar, a country seeing this population drop in half.</p></div></div>
<p>In recent years, we also start to see a more prominent role of the international community in dealing with statelessness. The UNHCR in 2014 launched its <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/ibelong/">#iBelong campaign</a> which calls for ending statelessness by 2024. Starting in 2018, the yearly database released by the UNHCR also includes information on Singapore and Cambodia. With this first step, the international community has to eventually take up the partial burden of ensuring basic human rights for these individuals. It is time to meet the 2024 deadline of ending statelessness.</p>
